	<button onclick="dropText('p2')" class="w3-button w3-block w3-left-align" style="font-weight: bold;">NFT Lottery (Solidity/Hardhat/Foundry)<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></button>
	<div id="p1" class="w3-container w3-hide">
  		<p>*Will be updating repo soon* Solidity implementation + tests (Hardhat & Foundry) for an NFT lottery. Sellers can deposit NFTs and specify sale parameters, and users can deposit ERC-20 tokens to enter for a chance to win the NFT at the end of the sale period - measures are taken to avoid getting funds or NFTs locked in the contract. Not used in production for legal reasons and currently not gas-optimized.</p>

	<div id="p3" class="w3-container w3-hide">
  		<p>Scans for volume spikes on specific tokens (exchange/tickers can be edited in the code), as well as scans for specific Twitter users following new accounts. Allows you to direct your attention towards large market moves without monitoring multiple charts constantly, and the Twitter feature can be useful in finding new projects early. Currently being improved; the "to do list" is specified in the repo's readme.</p>

	<div id="p7" class="w3-container w3-hide">
  		<p>This bot uses the Google Trends and Twitter APIs to trigger alerts when certain words jump in popularity. My initial intent was to use this to track SPAC activity, but it can be used in a variety of other ways as well. Discord alerts (using a Discord bot) are implemented in the project.</p>
