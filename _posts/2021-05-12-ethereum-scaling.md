### **What’s the Ethereum gas issue?**
Lately, Ethereum (ETH) gas fees have skyrocketed, cutting into the pockets of transactors and completely blocking out some low-capital participants. For those who aren’t familiar, gas fees are fees paid to process a transaction on Ethereum, and they go up as network congestion grows. As an example, let’s say you wanted to swap .005 ETH (at the time of this writing, worth about $20) for USDT, which is equal to $1, through Uniswap. Uniswap is a DeFi application that allows you to, among other things, swap two Ethereum-based tokens. When I attempt to do this swap today, May 12th, 2021, this happens:

That’ll be a $350 gas fee - insane. I would be at a net loss of about ~330 just to swap one token to another. Let’s also take a look at the Ethereum gas and daily transaction charts from 2018 to today:
