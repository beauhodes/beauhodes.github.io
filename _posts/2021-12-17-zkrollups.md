### **Intro**
I originally wrote this for subscribers of the UpNow Crypto Research firm, but I wanted to make it public because this technology is just so cool. Hopefully this can serve as a high-level overview of what ZK-rollups do and what makes them so useful. You can also visit <a href="upnowcrypto.com">upnowcrypto.com</a>  to learn more about our services!

ZK-rollups are quickly becoming a realistic way of scaling blockchains. To quote the article, "ZK-rollups (ZKRs) are going to play a massive role in the future of blockchain scalability. They can also help simplify the user experience, lower fees (over 20x cheaper than Ethereum!), and potentially provide great investment opportunities if you know where to look."
