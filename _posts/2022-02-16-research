### **Research Dump**
Here's a link to a Github repo containing some selected research that I've written over recent months - most of this is separate from the articles I have written on this site. It includes research such as:
- 2021 Crypto Reflection and 2022 Predictions
- ZK-rollup writeup
- Token reports on tokens such as SYN, JEWEL, MC, SOL, RBN, DPX, CRA, and OHM
- Update on YFI tokenomics
